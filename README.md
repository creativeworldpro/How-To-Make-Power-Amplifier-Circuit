In this project, we are going to teach you making a simple, cheap and powerful amplifier circuit.

A amplifier circuit is a electronics device that convert electronics power to a sound system.

It is a very powerful amplifier circuit and you can make this circuit at home easily. To listen song at home, office or inside car, track you can use this circuit.

Using only a few number of electronics component you can use this circuit at home easily.
You can operate this circuit, using only DC-12v.
